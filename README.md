# Zombiegame
 a zombi game
# how to play
with WASD, you need to eat the brains, so you'll unlock new skins.
# how to mod
add a image/wav file containing your new sound/image and name it whatever you want.
then paste the following JSON file in, the name doesn't matter either.
{
    "lvltarget": 1,
    "imagetarget": "brain.png",
    "image": "picture.png"
}
your lvl target means to what level your mod is applied to. If it's 1, you will get it at lvl 1. Etc.
imagetarget is the name of the image you want to replace. You can choose from zombie.png, brain.png, openBrain.png, bg.png, and brains.wav.
then image is the name you chose for your image. So if you downloaded an image and called it nevergonnagiveyouup.png, you should put that here too.
If you have these files, and you can make multiple, in the mods folder and run the game, it should work!
