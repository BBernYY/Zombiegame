# Zombiegame
 a zombi game
# how to play
with WASD, you need to eat the brains, so you'll unlock new skins.
# how to mod
add a image/wav file containing your new sound/image and name it whatever you want.
then create a new json file or copy one from the dog mod example folder.  
your "lvltarget" value means to what level your mod is applied to. If it's 1, you will get it at lvl 1. Etc.
"imagetarget" value is the name of the image you want to replace. You can choose from zombie.png, brain.png, openBrain.png, bg.png, and brains.wav.
then the "image" value is the name you chose for your image. So if you downloaded an image and called it nevergonnagiveyouup.png, you should put that here too.
If you have these files, and you can make multiple, in the mods folder and run the game, it should work!
